"88","2","assistant","Thanks for your explanations, TheMindsEye. I agree with you that in general a standard thumb is a good way to define image settings. There are, nevertheless, exceptions which deserve special treatment, especially in the area of art (including painting, sculpture and artistic photography) where the image is an extremely important part of the article. Like many other seasoned Wikipedians working in this area, I firmly believe it is useful to define larger image sizes in certain cases so that the reader can immediately appreciate the detail without having to bother about standard settings or clicking on the image to enlarge it. You can find thousands of examples but just take a look at . I think you will agree that if all the images in this article were reduced to standard thumbs, most readers would have a less vivid impression of the article's content. Some other examples in photography are , and . And as for general guidance, in the WP Manual of Style, you will see that there is provision in the for resizing images where appropriate. I will therefore resize the image to 300px which is perfectly acceptable for a lead image. If you still disagree, perhaps you would like to start a discussion on the article's talk page where others will also be able to participate.

Such a restoration may well be eligible for a speedy deletion. If I were you, I would simply replace your userpage with a link to a blogspot blog or something.

"97","4","assistant","Despite it being used for one at times, checkuser shouldn't be used for fishing expeditions. In most cases the people that do the checkuser will only do so if the sock has been used to circumvent a ban\/block, 3RR, or to change the outcome of a consensus discussion. So if you have reason to believe that Bigglove is a sock of Isarig, it is generally acceptable to request that a checkuser be run since Bigglove was in use during Isarig's block. However if the belief is that Bigglove is a sock of Qaiqu, you're pretty much out of luck as Qaiqu is currently not blocked\/banned and there isn't any overlap between their editing periods to indicate an attempt to circumvent 3RR or change the results of a consensus discussion. Another reason you're out of luck with using Checkuser on Qaiqu is the age of the user's last edit. I'm not sure exactly how long the information used for checkuser is kept, but from what I've seen any time an editor's last edit is over a month or two prior to the current date, it can not be run. --","1.188426960E09","Unknown","299557",""
