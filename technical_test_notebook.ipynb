    "# Technical Test: Chatbot Conversation Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this technical test, you'll be working with a dataset of movie conversations. Your task is to analyze this dataset, extract key metrics, and create visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "The dataset 'chatbot_conversations.csv' contains conversations between users and a chatbot. The structure is as follows:\n",
    "- `conversation_id`: Unique identifier for each conversation\n",
    "- `message_id`: Sequential ID of messages within a conversation\n",
    "- `role`: Who sent the message ('user' or 'assistant')\n",
    "- `content`: The actual text content of the message\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "1. Load and explore the dataset\n",
    "2. Find the longest and shortest conversations\n",
    "3. Create a histogram of conversation lengths\n",
    "4. Find the most common words (excluding stopwords)\n",
    "5. Find the longest word in the dataset\n",
    "6. Create at least one additional visualization of your choice\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "- Correct implementation of all tasks\n",
    "- Code efficiency and readability\n",
    "- Quality of visualizations\n",
    "- Insights derived from the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"
